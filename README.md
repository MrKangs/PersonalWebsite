This repository hosts my personal website that you can check out at [here](mrkangs.net). 

The based was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) and [react-mdl](https://tleunen.github.io/react-mdl/components/).

If you want to copy and use it for your own personal website, you need to install node.js and type ```npm install``` and ```npm start``` to start the server on your localhost. 

In this repository, there is a GitHub Action that will vertify if there any issues for building the website using React. 

In the home page, there will be my profile picture, my full name, my current position title, my hard skills, and my contact methods.
For now, this is a simple look as home page. However, as I spend more time in developing the website, I will add more interesting features such as some animation affects.

In the About Me Page, there is my description of myself with another picture of me. At the same time, there will be contact information for reaching me out directly rather than just knowing me in small depth. 
There will no be something new for a while. 

In the Resume page, it will link to my resume that it is uploaded in my personal google drive that people can view and download it for free.
In the future, I will make my own personal CV that it will be a shared folder that contains my resume and CV in the near future updates for this website.

In the Projects/Courses page, there will be my projects that I contributed or created and my courses notes and assignments that I did during my programming life. 
This page will be update when I create a new project so that people can take a look easily and give me great feedback to it. 

The favicon is a temporary icon that will be improve soon with better design. Once this design has been created, then this might be displace in my home page. 

If there anything you want to see in this website such as bugs, features, or some new design, please let me know! We can talk over GitHub Issue.
